# All the News That's Fit to Scrape

My 'All the News That's Fit to Scrape' application was built to update you on all the latest Chicago Cub headlines pulled direct from the most reliable source in town, the Chicago Tribune.  Stay current on all Cub-related news with one click of the 'Scrape' button on the site's homepage.  The site also allows you to delete articles you've read, or that don't interest you.  Last, you can also start a chat with your fellow Cub fans related to all the latest headlines.
