# All the News That's Fit to Scrape

The 'All the News That's Fit to Scrape' application was built to keep you updated on all of the latest Chicago Cub headlines pulled direct from the most reliable source in town, the Chicago Tribune.  Stay current on all Cub-related news with one click of the 'Scrape' button on the site's homepage - this action will scrape all the most recent articles from the Tribune.com website and save them to a back-end, mongoDB database.  The site also allows you to delete articles you've read, or that don't interest you, from the back-end database.  Last, you can even start a chat with your fellow Cub fans related to each headline.

### Technologies used in the build of this application included:
1.  Express
2.  Express-handlebars
3.  Request
4.  Cheerio
5.  MongoDB & MongoJS
6.  Body-Parser
